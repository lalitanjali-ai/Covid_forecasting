# Forecasting COVID-19 cases using SARS-CoV-2 Titers in Urban Wastewater

### Motivation:

Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, an accurate count of cases in the community is tracked by symptomatically and clinically diagnosed cases. 
This method has inherent drawback as many of the patients do not report the disease and/or maybe asymptomatic.
Studies have shown proof of gastro-intestinal disorders triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients and the occurrence of viral RNA in community wastewater plants [2]. 
Wastewater-based epidemiological surveillance can be used as an early warning system for disease outbreak and to forecast the rate of transmission in communities.
We intend to explore the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 titers in urban wastewater and the rate of infections in nearby communities and design models to forecast the rate of infections using titer information as proxy data (a.k.a Nowcasting).
